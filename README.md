# Adversarial Drone Defence Strategies in the Domain of Swarm Robotics

This code base is submitted along with the report as part of the requirement for the MEng Computer Science degree program at UCL. It is substantially the result of my own work except where explicitly indicated in the text. The report may be freely copied and distributed provided the source is explicitly acknowledged.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Steve Hailes, for his continued
and constant patience, guidance, feedback, support and encouragement during this project. It would
have been difficult to complete this research project without his input and the learning I gained from our
discussions.

The Github repo is organised as follows:
- Branch "Master": README
- Brnach "VA": code implementation for the Vector Arithemtic approach
- Brnach "GWO-EA": code implementation for the Grey Wolf Optimisation - Evolutionary Algorithm approach
- Brnach "CommNet": code implementation for the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Communication Network model approach
